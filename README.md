# Visnap7
Visnap7 Project
ViSnap7 is a framework for an easy developing of PLC-Siemens HMI.

The ViSnap7 core is a fork of Sharp7 developed in C# by Davide Nardella.

You can find more information regarding this project at http://snap7.sourceforge.net/

The idea of ViSnap7 is to be able to perform HMI without having to program each control.

Thus, after a very simple configuration (IP, Rack and PLC Slot) you will only have to drag and drop the controls, configure the memory address and that's it!
